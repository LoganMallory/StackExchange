# StackExchange
Can activity on StackExchange predict stock prices?

StackExchange, the parent platform of popular discussion boards including Stackoverflow, Server Fault, and Ask Ubuntu, is home to over 16 Million questions about software, databases, web apps, and more.

#### My hypothesis was that consumer adoption of software provided by software as a service (SaaS) or platform as a service (PaaS) companies could be tracked through the number of questions asked about that software on StackExchange platforms.

##### So how do tech stock prices correlate with question frequency on StackExchange?
